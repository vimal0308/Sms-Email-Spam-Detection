This project utilizes machine learning techniques to classify emails as either spam or ham (not spam). The model is trained using a dataset of labeled emails and implements text preprocessing and feature extraction methods like TF-IDF. The classifier is built with scikit-learn's Multinomial Naive Bayes and achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between spam and legitimate emails.
